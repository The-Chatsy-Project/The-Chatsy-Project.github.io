<h1>privacy</h1>
<p>Chatsy does not sell any data and we do not collect PII. Some chatsy bots may collect anonymized data for teaching our bots to be more intelligent.<br>
Any platform you chat with chatsy on may have its own privacy policy, and Chatsy Talkr uses Dialogflow, so you may want to check their policy too.</p>
